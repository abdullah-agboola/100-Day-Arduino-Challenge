Day 2: Traffic Light Simulator 🚦  

Project Description: Today’s project builds on the LED blinking concept from Day 1. We’ve created a Traffic Light Simulator that mimics the red, yellow, and green light sequence, just like the ones you see at a real intersection. It’s a great way to learn about timing and sequencing multiple outputs.

🛠️ Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs  
Resistors (220Ω recommended)  
Jumper wires  
Breadboard  

⚙️ Circuit Setup:  
Connect the red, yellow, and green LEDs to different digital pins on the Arduino.  
The negative terminals of all LEDs go to GND through resistors, and their positive terminals are connected to the digital pins.
