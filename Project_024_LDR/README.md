Project Description:

This project measures light intensity using an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) and displays the readings in real time on the serial monitor. A simple yet practical introduction to light-sensitive systems.

Components Used:  
LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor)  
Arduino Uno  
Resistor  
Jumper Wires  
Breadboard  

Circuit Setup:  
Connect one end of the LDR to the 5V pin on the Arduino and the other end to an analog pin (A0).  
Add a resistor between the analog pin and GND to form a voltage divider.
