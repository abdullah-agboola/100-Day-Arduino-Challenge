Day 16: Joystick-Controlled LED Quadrant Display

Project Description:
For Day 16, I used a joystick module to control four LEDs, each representing a specific direction. When the joystick moves in a particular direction, the corresponding LED lights up, visually indicating the joystick‚Äôs movement in that area. It's a simple yet fun way to get acquainted with joystick-based control in Arduino projects.

üõ†Ô∏è Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
Joystick Module  
4 LEDs  
Jumper Wires  
Breadboard  
Resistors (for each LED)  

‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Setup:  
The joystick‚Äôs X and Y outputs are connected to analog pins A0 and A1 on the Arduino.  
Each LED is connected to a digital pin.  
A resistor is connected between each LED's postive leg and the digital pin.
