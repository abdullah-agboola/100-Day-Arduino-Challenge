Day 11: KY-037 Analog Sound Sensor Plotter

Project Description: For Day 11, I explored the KY-037 analog sound sensor by displaying its readings on the Arduino serial plotter. This project captures and visualizes sound levels, updating every second to give a real-time graphical view of ambient sound.

🛠️ Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
KY-037 Sound Sensor Module    
Jumper Wires  
Breadboard  

⚙️ Circuit Setup:  
The analog output of the KY-037 was connected to an analog pin on the Arduino to capture sound levels.  
The sensor’s VCC and GND were connected to the Arduino’s 5V and GND respectively.
