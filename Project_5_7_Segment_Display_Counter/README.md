Day 5: 7-Segment Display Counter

Project Description: For this project, I used a 1-digit 7-segment display to count continuously from 0 to 9. It was a simple yet fun way to explore how the segments work. Some segments appeared brighter than others because I used different resistors—not for experimenting, but because I didn’t have enough of each type.

🛠️ Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
1-digit 7-Segment Display  
8 Resistors (different values)  
Breadboard  
Jumper wires  

⚙️ Circuit Setup:
Connect the 7-segment display to digital pins on the Arduino.  
Use a resistor for each segment connected to the display. Different resistors will lead to variations in brightness, so consistent values are ideal, but I worked with what I had.  
The breadboard was used to organize connections, with the common pin of the display connected to GND.
