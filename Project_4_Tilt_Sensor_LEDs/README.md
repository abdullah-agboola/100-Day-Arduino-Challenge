Day 4: Tilt Sensor LED

Project Description: For this project, I connected a tilt sensor to control two LEDs. One LED stays lit when the sensor is stable, and the other switches on if the sensor detects tilting. This is a simple demonstration of how tilt sensors can be used to detect motion and changes in orientation.

üõ†Ô∏è Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
Tilt Sensor  
2 LEDs  
2 Resistors (220Œ©)  
Jumper wires  

‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Setup:  
Connect one end of the tilt sensor to a digital pin on the Arduino, and the other end to the negative rail of the breadboard (GND).  
Connect the Green LED to a digital pin and the Red LED to another digital pin.  
Place a 220Œ© resistor in series with each LED, connecting them to the negative rail of the breadboard (GND).  
Use GND and 5V for common connections to the Arduino.
