Day 1: LED Blinker 💡  

Welcome to Day 1 of my 100-Day Arduino Challenge. Today’s project is a simple yet essential one: making an LED blink. It’s a classic starting point for Arduino enthusiasts, and a great way to get familiar with the basics of circuits and coding.

🛠️ Project Description  
In this project, I’ll make an LED turn on and off repeatedly. The circuit is straightforward and the code is easy to follow, making it ideal for beginners.

🔧 Components Used  
1 x Arduino Uno  
1 x LED (any color)  
1 x Resistor (220Ω recommended)  
Jumper wires  
Breadboard  

⚙️ Circuit Setup  
The negative terminal of the LED is connected to the GND (Ground) port of the Arduino Uno board through a resistor.  
The positive terminal of the LED is connected to digital pin 12 on the Arduino Uno.
