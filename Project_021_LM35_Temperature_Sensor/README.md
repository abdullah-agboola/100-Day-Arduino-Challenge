Day 21: LM35 Real-Time Temperature Display  

Project Description:  
For Day 21, I used the LM35 Temperature Sensor to display real-time temperature readings on the Serial Monitor. This sensor is simple to use and provides accurate temperature measurements in degrees Celsius, making it ideal for weather systems, smart devices, and more.

🛠️ Components Used:  
Arduino Uno    
LM35 Temperature Sensor  
Jumper Wires  

⚙️ Circuit Setup:  
Connect the VCC pin of the LM35 to 5V on the Arduino.  
Connect the GND pin of the LM35 to GND on the Arduino.  
Connect the OUT pin of the LM35 to Analog Pin A0 on the Arduino.
