Day 20: Servo Motor 

Project Description:  
For Day 20, I controlled a servo motor to move smoothly back and forth between two positions. Servo motors are versatile components commonly used in robotics, automated systems, and precise mechanical movements.

üõ†Ô∏è Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
Servo Motor (9g)  
Jumper Wires  

‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Setup:  
Connect the servo motor's signal pin (usually yellow or orange) to Digital Pin.  
Connect the VCC pin of the servo motor to 5V on the Arduino.  
Connect the GND pin of the servo motor to GND on the Arduino.
