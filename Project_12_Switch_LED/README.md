Day 12: Switch-Controlled LED

Project Description:
For Day 12, I created a simple circuit to control an LED using a switch. Pressing the switch turns on the LED, and releasing it turns it off—a foundational project for understanding input-output interactions in electronics.

🛠️ Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
LED  
Switch  
Resistor  
Jumper Wires  
Breadboard  

⚙️ Circuit Setup:  
The LED’s negative is connected to ground, and the positive terminal is connected to a digital pin through a resistor.  
One end of the switch connects to a digital pin, while the other end connects to ground through a resistor. This setup enables the Arduino to detect when the switch is pressed.
