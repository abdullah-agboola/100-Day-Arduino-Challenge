Day 6: Photoresistor with LED

Project Description: Today's project was all about using a photoresistor (LDR) to control an LED. There was a small delay because I initially used a 10k ohm resistor for the LDR, which didn’t work. After switching to a 220 ohm resistor, the project worked as expected. Just another learning curve along the way. 😊

🛠️ Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
Photoresistor (LDR)  
LED  
220 ohm resistor (previously tried 10k ohm)  
Breadboard  
Jumper wires  

⚙️ Circuit Setup:  
The LDR was connected between the analog pin (A0) and 5V.  
The 220 ohm resistor was placed between the LDR and GND.  
The LED was connected to a digital pin, with a resistor placed in series to limit the current.
