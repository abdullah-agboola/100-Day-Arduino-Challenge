Day 22: Demonstrating Series and Parallel Connections

Project Description:  
This project demonstrates the practical differences between series and parallel connections using LEDs, resistors, and a breadboard. Itâ€™s a simple yet effective way to visualize concepts that are foundational in physics and engineering.

Components Used:  
Breadboard  
LEDs  
Resistors  
Jumper wires

Circuit Setup:  
Series Connection: LEDs are connected end-to-end, sharing the same current.  
Parallel Connection: LEDs are connected separately, sharing the same voltage.
