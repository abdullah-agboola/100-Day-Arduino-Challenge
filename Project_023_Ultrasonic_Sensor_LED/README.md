Day 23: Proximity Alert System with Ultrasonic Sensor and LED  

Project Description:  
This project uses an ultrasonic sensor and an LED to create a proximity detection system. The LED switches on when an object is detected within 20 cm, making it ideal for applications like parking sensors, robotics, and security systems.

Components Used:  
Ultrasonic Sensor  
LED     
Resistors  
Jumper Wires  
Arduino Uno  

Circuit Setup:
Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino (VCC, GND, Trigger, Echo).  
Wire the LED to a digital pin with a current-limiting resistor.  
Code the Arduino to turn on the LED when the sensor detects an object within 20 cm.
