Day 25: Light Detection Alarm

Project Description:  
This project uses an LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) and an active buzzer to detect light and trigger an alarm. Itâ€™s a straightforward yet practical example of how sensors can be used for real-world applications.

Components Used:  
LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor)  
Active Buzzer  
Resistor  
Arduino Uno      
Jumper Wires  
Breadboard  

Circuit Setup:  
Connect the LDR and a resistor to form a voltage divider, with the midpoint connected to an analog pin.  
Connect the active buzzer to a digital pin.
