Day 13: Potentiometer-Controlled LED Bar Graph

Project Description:
For Day 13, I created a project using a potentiometer and five LEDs. As the potentiometer is adjusted, different numbers of LEDs light up, creating a bar graph that visually represents the potentiometer's position. This project demonstrates analog-to-digital conversion and is a great introduction to input scaling with Arduino.

üõ†Ô∏è Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
Potentiometer  
5 LEDs  
5 Resistors  
Jumper Wires  
Breadboard  

‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Setup:  
The LEDs are connected to digital pins 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, each with a resistor going to ground.  
The potentiometer is connected to the analog pin A5 on the Arduino, with the outer terminals connected to 5V and ground, and the middle terminal to A5.
