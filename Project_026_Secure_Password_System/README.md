Day 26: Secure Password System 🔐

Project Description:  
This project demonstrates a secure password system using an Arduino, a 4x4 matrix module, LEDs, and a buzzer. It’s a practical exploration of how access control systems operate.

Features:  
Keypresses trigger a buzzer and display * on the serial monitor for privacy.
“Enter” functionality to validate passwords:  
Correct password: Green LED lights up, and "Password is correct" appears on the serial monitor.  
Incorrect password: Red LED lights up, and "Incorrect password" is displayed.

🛠️ Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
4x4 Matrix Module  
Active Buzzer  
Green LED  
Red LED  
Resistors  
Breadboard  

⚙️ Circuit Setup:  
4x4 Matrix Module: Connect rows and columns to the appropriate digital pins on the Arduino.  
Active Buzzer: Connect to a digital pin for output and GND.  
Green LED: Connect to a digital pin with a resistor, and then to GND.  
Red LED: Connect similarly to another digital pin and GND.  
Power the setup using the Arduino and organize connections on the breadboard.
