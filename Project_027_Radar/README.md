Day 27: Radar System

Project Description:  
This project implements a radar system using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor. The system scans its surroundings, and if an object is detected within 20 cm, it triggers an LED and buzzer for alert.

Applications:  
Obstacle detection in robotics.  
Parking assistance systems.  
Smart automation for proximity alerts.  

üõ†Ô∏è Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
Ultrasonic Sensor  
Servo Motor  
Active Buzzer  
LED  
Resistors 
Jumper Wires  
Breadboard  

‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Setup:  
Ultrasonic Sensor: Attach to the servo motor and connect to Arduino for movement and distance detection.
Servo Motor: Controlled via a PWM pin on Arduino to rotate the sensor.  
LED and Buzzer: Connected to digital pins to activate alerts.  
Breadboard: Used for proper power distribution and connections.
