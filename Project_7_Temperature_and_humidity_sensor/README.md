Day 7: Temperature & Humidity Measurement with DHT11

Project Description: Today's project involved the DHT11 sensor, which measures temperature (in Celsius) and humidity. The setup took readings every second and displayed the results on the serial monitor for easy tracking.

🛠️ Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
DHT11 Module  
Breadboard  
Jumper wires  

⚙️ Circuit Setup:  
The DHT11 sensor was connected to the 5V power supply, GND, and a digital pin on the Arduino.  
Data was transmitted from the sensor to the Arduino, with readings being processed every second.  

📋 Note: To run the code, make sure you have the DHT library installed in your Arduino IDE. You can install it via:
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...  
Search for "dhtlib"  and click Install.
