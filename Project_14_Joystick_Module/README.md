Day 14: Joystick Module X and Y Axis Reader

Project Description:
For Day 14, I explored the joystick module. This project reads the joystick‚Äôs x and y-axis positions and displays these values on the serial monitor, allowing real-time tracking of movements. It‚Äôs an interesting way to visualize analog input from a joystick.


üõ†Ô∏è Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
Joystick Module  
Jumper Wires    

‚öôÔ∏è Circuit Setup:  
The joystick's x-axis and y-axis pins are connected to analog pins A0 and A1 on the Arduino, respectively.  
The VCC and GND of the joystick are connected to the 5V and GND pins on the Arduino.
