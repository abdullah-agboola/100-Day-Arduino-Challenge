Day 9: Police Siren Simulation

Project Description: For Day 9, I built a mini police siren simulation! The passive buzzer generated a siren sound, and the RGB module flashed between red and blue.

🛠️ Components Used:  
Arduino Uno  
Passive Buzzer  
RGB Module  
Jumper Wires  
Breadboard  

⚙️ Circuit Setup:  
The passive buzzer was connected to a digital pin to generate sound.  
The RGB module was wired to digital pins to control the red and blue colors alternately.
